    <h1>Experience Analysis</h1>

    <h2>
      1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
      the experience?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The site begins with an intro/loading sequence. I tested it on a few
      different platforms; using Safari on a Mac desktop the site loaded almost
      immediately, and it took around the same amount of time using Chrome on a
      windows laptop. However, when using Safari on iPad and iOS the site loads
      for around a minute and a half before repeatedly crashing once the user
      begins to scroll. The loading screen (when you actually have time to see
      it) is pretty engaging, showing the building being sketched.
    </p>

    <h2>
      2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
      discrete actions.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first segment of the experience has the user moving through drone
      footage of the Walt Disney Concert Hall. It then shows the user a series
      of videos detailing the initial design of the concert hall, alongside a
      button that when clicked brings up a 3D model of the hall's interior that
      can be viewed at from multiple angles and clicked on in certain locations
      to reveal further information and images. The next segment shows a chapter
      title, then a short section that most closely resembles a traditional
      news/education article. The user is then shown another series of videos,
      alongside a button that allows them to explore a 3d model of the hall's
      exterior that functions the same as the previous one. The user then
      scrolls through more article-like text and images, broken up by dynamic
      headers that change shape as the user scrolls through them. These article
      sections aren't completely flat, there are elements that grow and shrink
      as the user scrolls, and parts of the site that stay fixed on one side as
      the other half of the page scrolls. There is then a third video section
      followed by a model of the concert hall's organ that functions the same
      way as the previous two. This is then followed by the final article
      section of the site, and then a brief scroll through drone footage flying
      away from the building to bookmark the experience. There is then an
      in-depth index of archived media from the designing of the building. This
      section can be expanded for more information. The site ends with an
      acknowledgements and credits section. Through the whole experience, the
      sound toggle and menu buttons stay pinned to the top right of the site.
      The menu button brings up a link to each chapter when pressed.
    </p>

    <h2>
      3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Overall I think the sections of the site I spent the most time on were the
      video portions, simply because they take their time to explain the details
      of the design process. They weren't that interactive though, apart from
      being able to easily skip to the next/previous video by clicking on the
      left/right side of the screen. The parts I spent the most time on that I
      would actually consider interactive were the 3D models - I was interested
      in the story so I spent time going through each module to learn more.
    </p>

    <h2>
      4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
      experience?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The site uses scrolling as its primary form of interaction. There are also
      moments in which the user is encouraged to click for more information or
      drag a 3D model around, but from the beginning to the end the user scrolls
      through the page in order to experience the story.
    </p>

    <h2>
      5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
      experience?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I think the main goal of the experience is to educate people about the
      creation of the Walt Disney Concert Hall in a manner that is engaging,
      unique, and fun.
    </p>

    <h2>
      6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The experience is pretty immediately interactive and playful, showing the
      way it intends to educate the user. Even for a user not interested in the
      content of the site, it's hard not to have a good time simply scrolling
      through the footage, videos, and 3d models.
    </p>

    <h2>
      7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
      over time? (For how long and how many different times)
    </h2>
    <p>
      I think the experience is an engaging, fairly short experience best suited
      for those interested in architectural design and how it relates to music.
      Something unique about this site is that it could take a good amount more
      time to experience depending on the user's investment in the content. For
      an uninterested user there are plenty of opportunities to simply skip
      through information. On the flip side, for someone particularly invested
      there are equally as many opportunities to learn much more than a typical
      site might show. That being said, I can't imagine this being a site people
      would revisit over and over. It tells an interesting story, but not one
      infinitely repeatable.
    </p>

    <h2>
      8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
      interacted with over time?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The site is happy to let the user skip through at their leisure - it would
      rather the user stay to watch the videos, as there are distinct progress
      bars showing how far through the content the user is alongside warnings of
      "leaving the interactive story" that appear if the user scrolls past the
      video content without finishing it. Ultimately though the experience
      doesn't really change based on if you want to speed through or take it
      slow. At no point does it lock the user anywhere.
    </p>

    <h2>
      9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
      reference?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The experience explicitly references 67 archived pieces in the index at
      the bottom of the page. These pieces include photographs, physical and
      digital models, and sketches that help illustrate the design process of
      the concert hall. Aside from the index there are photos and videos
      throughout the experience that are used to give more detail about
      information spoken about/written about in the article sections. The site
      uses familiar visual language from other mediums at a few points - the 
      article sections are reminicisent of traditional books/magazines, the 
      video sections are similar to any other typical video player and the 3d 
      models are controlled in a way that would be familiar to anyone with 
      experience playing a 3d game or using a 3d model software. 
    </p>

    <h2>
      10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
      when engaging with your research experience?
    </h2>
<p>
  I think the main point of the photos and videos in the article are to further 
  inform and engage the user in the story being told. The use of familiar styles
  of interaction seems mainly
  in the name of allowing easy access to the information. The user is never unsure 
  of what to do because the site makes it clear what to do in order to continue 
  through its content. The article sections are obviously intended to be scrolled 
  through like any typical news site. The video sections are intended to be watched 
  and can be skipped through or revisited in ways similar to other video players. 
  The 3D model interactions have clear instructions but are also intuitive to those 
  familiar, allowing an experienced user to easily experience the site to its full
  effect.
</p>
    <h2>
      11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
      feel when engaging with your research experience?
    </h2>
<p>
  I think the article sections most affected my feelings about the site - The format
  and content of those sections felt the most like a professionally written piece 
  documenting the creation of this building. They made engaging with the site feel 
  important and educational to me.
</p>
    <h2>
      12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part frustrating?
    </h2>
<p>
  In my opinion, the most frustrating part of the interaction was my inability 
  to access the site propetly on platforms other than a desktop web browser. It 
  would have been easier for me to do this assignment if I could have viewed the
  site on my iPad, the platform I use most often. I understand adding this 
  compatibility would greatly increase the complexity of the site, but it would 
  make it a lot more widely accessible.
</p>
    <h2>
      13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part satisfying?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I personally found scrolling to alter the drone footage the most
      satisfying part of the interaction. I'm not sure how much of it was
      intentional, but it's simply fun to watch the sweeping shots reverse and
      pan backwards and forwards through very little effort from the user.
